    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Use this recipe for perfectly cooked hard-boiled eggs. By adding a little vinegar and salt, the eggshell peels off so easily without tearing or sticking. 
        I have been making them this way for years!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>White vinegar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients (excluding egg) in a large pot
            and wait for the water to boil.</li>
        <li>Add the egg slowly and reduce the heat to a gentle boil. 
            Cook for 14 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, 
            and place into a container of ice water or cold, 
            running water. Cool completely, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
